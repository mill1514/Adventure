Trial map1:

	Four rooms in a square:

		2 -- 1
		|    |
		3 -- 4

	All empty

	N, E, S, W

	1: 0,0,4,2
	2: 0,1,3,0
	3: 2,4,0,0
	4: 1,0,0,3
	
	ids are the nums
	names are the ids phonetically
	one item in each room, random stuff related to id of room
		id is scene id twice ie scene 1 item 11

	abilities:
		go, look/inspect, quit

	for loading:
		for now, just do it in main.cpp	



improvables:


	-Try to safegaurd against resizing
	-Clean stuff up with more functions
	-Implement "get"
	-Graphic(s)?
		-Map? Shows rooms you've been in?
			- compass too, shows options for movement
	-put "using namespace std" through entire code body
	-Grafitti on the wall that says "<player> SUX"
		-formatted string in the .lvl file?


bitch_town.lvl:

	-level with more complex shape
	-Meant to test compass
	-Also to see how making levels is
		-Not bad
	
	-Array of visited rooms?
		-Not sure if should be in player or level
