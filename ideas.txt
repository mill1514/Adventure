Text Game!

	You are just some random guy
	Find something magical
		genie?
		a billion dollars?
	as many binary decisions as possible
		try to keep interesting, jeez


	age picking determined by waiting (? just gameplay?)
	name picking determined by indecisiveness
		name generator! 	


	saving system! to somekinda .txt file or maybe
		a cool extension? .adv?? .dot? .dope?


	the goal of the game is to buy as many jetpacks as you can
	first he finds a billyun dollars
		if he invests it in a CD he gets a gajillion dollars
			he can buy like 2 or 3 jetpacks
		if he spends it on volatile penny bonds 
			random chance, 1/100 he gets unlimited money
			can buy as many jetpacks as he wants
		if he buys a yacht, 
			where does he go?
			if he goes to jetpack island
				they have like 12 jetpacks there
				only 1 is for sale
				you better have a million dollars boi
		if he donates all of the money to charity
			he finds a billion more dollars
				repeat the fucking game boi
		if he sells the money for 100 dollars
			if he sells that money for 12 dollars
				if he buys one drink from starbucks
					he has a productive afternoon
					he finally does that thing he's been putting off
					he feels really good about that
				if he converts it to change
					if he slowly spends it on candy
					doesn't really regret it but i mean come on
				if he spends it on a netflix subscription
					he's set 
			if he buys the new call of duty
				he becomes mlg
				he can no ssckope
				with the best of them
			if he converts it to bitcoin
				it becomes confusing and he basically wastes the money
				what an asshole
		if he uses it to kickstart his stand up comedy tour
			it is surprisingly well-reviewed, but he becomes disillusioned with his own talents
			he eventually gives it up, ends up with 1.5 billyun dollars
			longer he waits, the more royalties and sponsorship deals he gets
			at age 73 he dies
		if he takes the money and buys his mother a new house
			she dies on the way to see it for the first time
			he never got to say how sorry he was about not converting to islam
		if he buys a sniper rifle
			if he shoots the mayor
				Donald Trump is the new mayor
				makes him great again
			if he shoots the sheriff
				still goes to jail
				didn't/doesn't shoot the deputy
			if he shoots the gas station
				his mother was getting gas and he didn't see
				he never got to apologize for getting the tattoo of the baby he never had
			if he shoots his eye out
				he gets a d minus
				he gets a football
				what a load
			if he shoots straight up into the air
				he hits an airplane
				his mother was in the airplane
				he never got to tell her about how fast he can run
		if he buys two pistols
			if he aims them at eachother and shoots at the same time
				the two bullets merge and the pressure forms a black hole
		if he still lives a humble life and ignores the money
			he eventually forgets
			maybe saves up enough for 1 jetpack
			probably buys something else instead
		if he invests in space travel
			he gets to the moon
			inspires a space boom
			more people start wanting space travel stuff
			more people get to the moon
			more people want space stuff
			more people need jetpacks
			demand goes up, jetpacks become cheaper to make eventually
			its just simple economics
			but since he was one of the first he is flat broke and still cant buy em
		if he asks his mother what to do
			she says he should put it away for a rainy day
			has a heart attack on the phone before you can respond
			you were going to say that you loved her shirt that she wore sometimes
			never can you say that now
		if you put it away for a rainy day
			if you use it later during a rainy day
				it really brightens up your rainy day
				you use it to buy 3 jetpacks
			if you use it before a rainy day occurs
				you kinda spoil the fun but it still cheers you up
				you spend it on some video games
				theres nothing wrong with that
		if you fuck the system
			if you dont follow the rules
				if you cant be contained
					eventually you get tamed
					you are shown to be a tool publicly
					how could you think this was okay
			if you down low still follow the rules
				this was probably the safest way to go 
				anarchists don't hate you 
				neither do most regular people
				you don't excell at really anything
				you kind of have an identity crisis	
				you have a complex
				you seek approval
		if you just don't work anymore
			if you get lazy
				before you know it the money starts to run out
				damn
			if you get off your ass finally and start working
				if you relapse 
					things are tough for a while
					dont worry about it champ
					some people just gotta work twice as hard
				if you stay clean
					you remember everything
					you wonder if it was worth it	
					you never stop missing the high
			if you do the bare minimum 
				nobody really tells you that you suck
				but you'll figure it out
		if you tell everybody about it
			if you start bribing cops
				you get busted bitch
			if you start bribing the mayor
				you get maga bitch
			if you start bribing your mom
				she dies in a fire
				how could you
			if you start bribing the local news
				they make your town very liberal
				your county votes blue for many years to come
				the democratic policies give people opportunities to change
				people start turning their lives around in a big way
				the community comes together
				small businesses begin to sprout from the small town
				after several successful businesses, the city becomes a hub
				tech businesses are but one of the many avenues 
				a few jetpack companies are finally produced
				this is the moment you've been waiting for
				you grab the opportunity and buy the business
				you make a few successful patent purchases and put a chokehold on the industry
				your monopoly allows you to throttle the others until you control it all
				you sell the company at its peak and take with you 100 jetpacks
